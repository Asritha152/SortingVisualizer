# Sorting Visualizer

A simple Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process with bars of varying heights.

## ✨ Features

🔀 Randomize Array: Generates a new random array of bars.

📊 Sorting Algorithms Implemented:

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Selection Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

🎥 Animations: Bars swap or rearrange with smooth delays for better visualization.

🖥️ Interactive UI: Buttons to trigger each sorting algorithm.

🚀 How It Works

Click Randomize to generate a new array.

Select one of the sorting algorithm buttons.

Watch how the bars rearrange step by step until sorted.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – layout and buttons.

CSS – styles the bars and container.

JavaScript – implements sorting algorithms and animations.

## ▶️ How to Run

Clone or download this repository.

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Click Randomize and start sorting!

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Add speed control (fast/slow animations).

Add array size control (more/less bars).

Color highlights for comparisons and swaps.

Display the time complexity of each algorithm.
